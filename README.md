# cwc_calculator

![](demo.png)

notes:
- started with counter to get into tkinter
- took exactly three hours to get through both
- students appreciated implementing their own operators/functions, or coming up with new ones

# paint app:

notes:
- scrapped save due to needing to install ghostscript, plus had issues with artifacts in saved file
- didn't have enough time to have students implement their own features, may want to narrow it down in the future (scrapping saved files will probably fix that)
